  I love the story line, music and pictures. 
  Everytime I rewatch this movie, 
  it feels a getaway from reality 
  and living Sophie's life with her in Europe.

<h3>Whisper of the Heart</h3>

<p>
  Tokyo city looks so pretty pictured by this director. 
  All the details about charaters' daily lives brought back my memory grown up in the 90's. 
  I love the theme that boys and girls are chasing their dreams in real life not as a fantacy.

<h3>The Harry Potter Films</h3>
